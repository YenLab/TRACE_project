TRACE Uncovers Three RUNX1 Binding Classes with Distinct Functional Divergence
Transcription factors (TFs) recognize specific DNA sequences in the genome to modulate transcription, which is crucial for cell development and disease. Current in vitro reconstitution techniques for studying TF-DNA binding are complex and often rely on synthetic DNA, leading to discrepancies between experimental results and biological conditions. To address these challenges, we developed the Tagging and Recovery of Associated Chromatin Elements (TRACE) based on tagged immunoprecipitation. TRACE simplifies protein purification and incorporates endogenous，non-synthetic DNA, overcoming the limitations of synthetic DNA-based methods. Using TRACE, we uncovered two TF binding patterns: sharp (PRDM1) and broad (RUNX1). Within the broad pattern, RUNX1 utilizes novel motif arrays for DNA binding. Multi-omics analysis identified three RUNX1 binding site categories—classic motifs, motif arrays, and no-motif—each associated with distinct biological functions. In summary, TRACE advances TF-DNA interaction studies and reveals novel insights into TF recognition modes.
